# LOAN DEFAULT PREDICTION
# The primary goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can assess the risk of loan default for loan applicants. The objective is to help financial institutions make informed decisions about whether to approve or reject loan applications.
## The data consist of the following columns:
### Age-the age of the person in integers.
### Gender-gender of the person in categorical feature.
### Income-Income of the person in Integers.
### Employment_Status-Wether the person is Employed or not.
### Location-Location of the person wether he is living in urban,suburban or rural.
### Credit_Score-credit score of that person.
### Debt_to_Income_Ratio-the total debt to income of that person.
### Existing_Loan_Balance-Wether the person having any existing loan if yes then the balance to pay.
### Loan_Status-wether the loan can given or Not.
### Loan_Amount	Interest_Rate	- the interest rate for the loan.
### Loan_Duration_Months- the duration of the loan.
# Approach:
## Data Preprocessing: 
#### This task involves cleaning, transforming, and preparing the loan applicant data. It includes handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling or normalizing numerical features.
## Model Building: 
#### Develop a machine learning or statistical model capable of predicting the risk of loan default for each applicant. Common approaches include logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, gradient boosting, or support vector machines.
## Model Evaluation: 
#### Assess the performance of the loan default risk prediction model using appropriate evaluation metrics. Common metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, and AUC (Area Under the Curve).
## Interpretability & Reporting:
#### Provide interpretability for the model's predictions and create reports that offer insights into the risk assessment process. Transparency and interpretability are crucial when dealing with financial decisions
